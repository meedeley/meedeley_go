Here are two examples of using Apache License, Version 2.0 and MIT License.

### Apache License, Version 2.0
This license requires to put following content at the beginning of every file:

Replace [yyyy] with the creation year of the file. Then use personal name for personal projects, or organization name for team projects to replace [name of copyright owner].
### MIT License

### Other Note
- Other types of license can follow the template of above two examples.

- If a file has been modified by different individuals and/or organizations, and multiple licenses are compatiable, then change the first line to multiple lines and sort them in the order of time:
## Project structure
```
bin/        # The directory for compiled binaries or executables
cmd/        # Contains the main applications for the project
db/         # Database migrations, seeds, or configurations
docs/       # Documentation files for the project
internal/   # Private application code
pkg/        # Code that's safe to be shared between different parts of the project
storage/    # Directory for file storage or static assets
tests/      # Test files and test utilities
```
### Additional directories and files:
- `.air.toml`: Configuration file for live-reloading with `air`.
- `.env`: Environment variables for the project.
- `.env-example`: A sample file to guide the creation of `.env`.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to ignore in Git.
- `go.mod`: Go module dependencies file.
- `go.sum`: Checksums for module dependencies.
- `main`: Entry point of the application.
- `Makefile`: Contains common commands to build or manage the project.
- `README.md`: Project documentation and guidance.
